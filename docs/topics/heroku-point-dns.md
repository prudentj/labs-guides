# Heroku PointDNS Setup

Heroku doesn't offer nameservers. This means we must use a 3rd party
DNS provider in order to assign a custom domain to an app. There are
a number of ways to do this; the method described here is compatible
with the Lambda Labs domain name process.

## Objective

### Summary

We will walk through the basic steps of setting up a free custom domain with
Heroku using PointDNS.

!!! Info
    Heroku requires a credit card on file to activate PointDNS (as well as to
    support more than 3-4 apps at a time). PointDNS is free but it does need to
    be an actual credit card. The card will not be charged; it doesn't even have
    to have any funds available.

### Technologies

- heroku cli
- PointDNS add-on

!!! Info
    DNS stands for Dynamic Name System.

    Domain names are resolved using what is known as nameservers. Nameservers are
    servers that match domain names with targets (IP addresses). Nameservers allow
    users to visit [google.com](http://google.com) from anywhere in the world and
    be connected to a google server geographically close to the user. The actual
    IP address can changes, but the domain name doesn't.

## Getting Started

1. Find a domain on Namecheap that cost less than $15/year
2. Add the PointDNS Add-on to the production Heroku app (see Notes on PointDNS)
> `> heroku addons:create pointdns:developer -a app-name-fe-prod`
3. Add the domain to the Heroku app to get the **DNS target**
> `> heroku domains:add example.com -a app-name-fe-prod`
4. Keep the terminal open. You will need the **DNS target** which will look
something like this
> `> tranquil-brook-randomString.herokudns.com`
5. Log into PointDNS from Heroku by clicking on the PointDNS Add-on in the
Heroku dashboard
6. Click on the domain
7. Edit the CNAME record
    - Name should be the domain name you entered on Step 3
    - Data is the DNS target you created on Step 3
8. Click on Nameservers, copy 4 nameservers
9. Send a message to your SL with the Domain to be purchased using the template
below and 4 nameservers from the PointDNS pool
10. After your SL submits the request, your domain will be purchased in 1-3 days

### Template for Custom Domain Requests

Use this template for submitting custom domain requests to your SL.

```
Domain Name: 
Name Servers:
1. 
2.
3.
